mLore="Efreets are the chaotic counterparts to Djinns, although it is unknown if these magical beings share a mutual origin. It is believed that at least some Efreets were originally ambitious (and foolish) Wizards who tried to channel a Djinn's essence into their own bodies. Unable to control their new-found powers, they were instead consumed by them and reborn as chaotic spirits.\n\nRare resources to hire: \n1 Dragon Blood Crystal"
